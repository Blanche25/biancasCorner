        <h1>linux has consumed me</h1>

            wassup gamers
            <br><br>
            so as you might know from my about page, i use linux. more specifically, arch linux (btw). <br>
            i actually first tried linux a couple years ago, but gave up after having some problems and not knowing how to solve them. things like
            KDE randomly freezing, my laptop dying whenever i went to suspend it, Gnome being a little bitch about theming libadwaita apps (still pissed about that tbh),
            and other things like me not being able to figure out how to run some games (i absolutely refused to read any documentation ;-;).
            <br><br>
            after that attempt i did try linux again a couple times, i tried Manjaro, Fedora, Manjaro again and Endeavour for about half an hour.
            none of those quite worked out so i just gave up for a while, which was a bummer since linux seemed actually pretty cool and i was
            getting sick of Windows, so much so that instead of using the default iso by Microsoft i started using some debloated images when
            installing it (no Microsoft, i do not need fuckin candy crush and onedrive on my pc).
            <br><br>
            so ive been using win11 till this january, when i decided to give linux yet another try. i chose arch this time around, since i heard it was pretty
            bare bones and customisable, and i wanted to try a window manager instead of a desktop environment. so i installed it with the help of a tutorial, installed hyprland and
            started customising it immediately. i really like hyprland, though it did take me a bit to figure out how to work with a wm.
            <br><br>
            thing is, i think i might've gotten a bit too into customising. now mind you, customisation is one of the biggest reasons i switched to linux,
            i never really liked how locked down other systems are. that said, i may or may not have spent like 3 months changing my setup constantly... BUT i think
            it was worth it, for i now possess the *ultimate system(tm)*.
            <br><br>
            basically the way i have it set up right now is that i've got literally everything hooked up to <a href="https://github.com/misterio77/flavours">flavours</a>,
            which is a great project for swapping colorschemes across programs, and it is so cool like i cant get over how cool this is.
            my main gripe with ricing was that i often wanted to switch colorschemes, which was a bother because every time i'd have to either go
            and change the colors myself for every single program, or replace the themes i was using with another one, which often didn't even exist! <br>
            flavours pretty much fixes this and also allows me to theme apps that i didnt even have themes for before, it's great.
            i actually have a rofi script that makes a menu for quickly switching colorschemes without having to use the terminal.
            here's some screenshots of my setup because god forbid i don't flex a bit:
        <div class="image-grid">
            <div class="image-item"><img src="../assets/blogimgs/deskbiscuit.png"></div>
            <div class="image-item"><img src="../assets/blogimgs/deskcatppuccin.png"></div>
            <div class="image-item"><img src="../assets/blogimgs/deskparadise.png"></div>
        </div>
        <div id="overlay" class="overlay">
          <img id="overlayImage" src="" alt="Enlarged" />
        </div>
        <small>(also unrelated but i have added a zoom effect and overlay to images and i think it looks pretty cool)</small><br><br>

        so as you can see, my setup is peak, it's fire, it's the peak of desktop, the platonic ideal of a desktop, it does not, in fact, get better than this, and it has already been
        scientifically proven.
