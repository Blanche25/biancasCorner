                i think you should go listen to Constant Companions (Deluxe
                Edition). pretty please? prettiest of pleases?
                i listened to it and i mean oh my god. oh my fucking god.
                <br /><br />
                is this blog post just an excuse to gush about music i like
                under the pretense of a review?
                <br />
                yes, yes it is.
                <br /><br />
                so! this isn't going to be a review of every single song in the
                album, i'm just gonna go over things that i particularly liked
                about the entire thing and maybe make some examples along the
                way.
                <br /><br />
                first, the obvious: Constant Companions (Deluxe Edition) is
                Jamie Paige's latest album, and it exists as a more complete
                version of the original Constant Companion, as
                <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/jamiepaige/786929481822748672/stay-tuned-alt-texttranscription-happy?source=share">explained by Jamie herself</a>.
                <br />
                it has 5 extra songs, 4 of them at the end of the album and one
                of them, Clouddrop, inbetween already existing songs.
                <br /><br />
                Constant Companions was already a banger, easily my
                favorite Jamie Paige album and among my favorites of all time.
                But my god the extra tracks on this one elevate it to heights
                never before thought possible by mere mortals.
                <br />
                but, you may be asking yourself, my blissfully ignorant reader,
                "Bianca, what the fuck are you on about?" and i am LITERALLY
                about to tell you my god can you like wait a minute?????
                <br /><br />
                first off i think is the music itself, every song is rich in
                every possible aspect, from melody to harmony to
                instrumentation, though the latter isn't exactly my area of
                expertise. each song has so much going on, and the developments
                aren't always so predictable as one would expect.
                <br />
                also the leitmotifs, there is just so many leitmotifs in every
                single track. There's the obvious Constant Companions leitmotif,
                which is basically the "baby do you know what you wanna hear?"
                line which has been burned into my cortex i hear it in my sleep.
                but also so many tracks have their own leitmotifs that appear in
                OTHER tracks and everything just plays all at once in "Dance
                Delightful", the album's last track which serves as an amazing
                conclusion and also as a sort of recap of all previous tracks.
                <br /><br>
                harmonically there's also a lot to talk about, i like fancy
                chords and weird lil' progressions, and there's plenty here, so
                needless to say my thirst was sated. though i'm not gonna go
                into too much detail, since i definitely am not doing a harmonic
                analysis of every single song on the album. yet.
                <br />
                i absolutely loved the lyrics of every track, which isn't
                something i say often, since i find it's rare that i get
                particularly swept away by a song's lyrics, but once again Jamie
                Paige makes me die just thinking about her lyrics (in a good way
                i promise).
                <br />
                one of the most interesting ones in that regard, at least in my
                opinion, is Object of Affection. the lyrics in that one make me
                go insane. i really liked the more ornate language used, as i think
                it's definitely not a common style in songs, and apparently,
                <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/jamiepaige/767698123397201920/constant-companions-closeup-9-object-of?source=share">according to a tumblr post by Jamie,</a>
                it's about a trans prince
                that gets turned into a doll which sounds sick as hell honestly.
                <br><br>
                Clouddrop is easily my favorite song in the entire album, possibly my
                 favorite ever.
                it's the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/jamiepaige">"seven minute long behemoth"</a>
                that was originally cut from Constant Companions.
                <br>
                not gonna talk too much about it, but it's a great song, the lyrics are insane, so is the
                music, just go listen to it.
