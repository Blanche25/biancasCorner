            hello!
            <br><br>
            i'm an it student from italy currently studying to become a full-stack developer.
            <br><br>
            in my free time i like playing classical guitar, which i also studied for a bit in
            a conservatory, i compose "music" and i play ttrpgs with friends (which despite what
            other sources might tell you, i do have).
            <br><br>
            as for my set up, i use a zenbook 14 running cachyOS, with niri as my wm.
        </p>
