        <h1>doomscrolling and such</h1>
        <small class="date">19th jul 2025</small>
        <p>
            i've always kinda had problems with my screentime, worsened by abysmal ability to focus on tasks (or viceversa, tbf). <br>
            the time i spend daily on stuff like youtube or instagram or whatever else i'd rather spend doing literally anything else more fulfilling, i have many
            hobbies that i unfortunately tend to neglect, making music, coding, journaling, reading and etc. <br>
            the thing about spending so much time scrolling is that i didn't even like it. every time i close out whichever app i was in i'm like "well that was
            a waste of time, i learned nothing and actually i feel worse than i did before",
            <br><br>
            so i think something like a year ago i decided to delete most stuff on my phone, except maybe youtube because i am weak, in an attempt to fix my problem.
            definitely didn't work, but it was a first step, so sometime after that i started putting screentime limits on a bunch of apps, which worked a lot better
            for keeping me off doomscrolling, though sometimes i still temporarily removed those limits because god forbid i miss my 4 hours of daily youtube.
            <br><br>
            still, wanting to go further, i started putting limits on websites on my pc as well, and i tried to get myself to write more in my diary and do
            stuff i actually wanted to do, which, to be fair, worked kinda ok, i wrote an <a href="../music.html">original piece for guitar</a>, started doing a lot
            of worldbuilding for a d&d campaign i want to run, and i made a website! i even got to playing more video games i wanted to try, which was a lot more difficult
            when the option of being entertained for no effort was right there and also free.
            now every time i pick up my phone i can actually use it for what i inteded to instead of getting sucked into hell, which i think is pretty cool.
            <br><br>
            i did notice while doing all of this, that besides mindless entertainment, i did actually rely on social media for some things, mainly recommendations of other
            media, like video games and music. <br>
            thankfully, this turned out to actually be a good thing! i did always think it was not great for me to just absorb the tastes of everyone i follow online, and the other
            methods for discovering new stuff are, i think, a lot better anyways.<br>
            one thing that helped me is <a href="https://youtu.be/wbDIIQ2ExPw?si=A7qYKlVmCXfAwVuP">this video</a> by Notes From The Archives, in which he talks about how he
            discovers new music without social media.
            <br><br>
            sooo yeah that's about it, recently i've been into self improvement stuff and actually making myself a better person, and i'm pretty happy with the progress i made
            so far, even if it's not that much in perspective.
