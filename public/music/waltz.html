            ALAS! AN ORIGINAL PIECE I AM HAPPY WITH!<br>
            this one took a bit longer than i anticipated, i started writing it in september
            and only now got around to finishing it. i got inspired to make this after listening
            to Hirokazu Sato's Waltz of North Wind (if you've never heard of Hirokazu Sato, do check
            out his compositions, they're some of my favorites to play), if you listen to it you
            might even recognize the main two chords i borrowed.
            <br><br>
            all in all, flows better than i thought, and it's pretty fun to play.
