            most of the stuff i write/transcript is for classical guitar, so that's your warning
            for anyone out there with a deep irrational fear of string instruments. oh also
            sometimes instead of actual recordings there'll be midi version of songs, usually
            because i either couldn't be bothered/it requires multiple people/i made it too hard.</p><br>

                        small composition for classical guitar i made in about half a day after hearing the melody in my head when i woke up (which for some
                        reason happened multiple times?). it's the first original piece i'm putting on here,
                        i think it turned out good enough, i'm pretty proud of it.

                    this is a 5 part arrangement for guitar orchestra (i think thats how it's called in english?).<br>
                    as you might've been able to tell, i'm a big fan of Toby Fox. like, come on he literally invented it smh.
                    anyways, this was probably my favorite song of the whole Deltarune ch.1 OST (aside from Rude Buster maybe).
                    this arrangement is a bit tricky in some parts, but i think it's reasonable.

                    i love homestuck so much... this is for 3 guitars and a bass (though 4 guitars is fine tbh)<br>
                    this one took me WAY too long... so many revisions... in the end it was worth it though,
                    it's came out pretty nicely all things considered, i just wish i had someone to
                    actually play it with, i have like 3 musician friends and none of them really like
                    classical unfortunately.
