            this is a little section (once again inspired by <a href="https://juneish.neocities.org/">june's website</a>)
            where i guess i just document the different themes the site's gone through, since i thought it'd be nice
            to be able to look back at what this hole used to looked like.

                    ok so this was the very first version of the website, which uh, is basically, like... me trying
                    as hard as i could to replicate an old version of june's website? i liked
                    the sketchbook aesthetics, i guess i got kinda close...
                    but it didn't exactly look great lol. here i was actually kinda struggling to think of stuff
                    to put on the site, so i was just playing around with the layout.

                    site got a bit cleaner, now featuring the most overused color palette on planet earth: cattpuccin!
                    i remember for a while i tried making the grid background move but every time it either looked
                    bad or i got motion sick. there were a couple of small updates, the last.fm widget got changed,
                    the blog got an rss feed, and the grid items got fancy colors.

                    this one was actually pretty cool. i made it so that by having different css files with different color
                    variables i could just swap out colorschemes by simply changing a line in my stylesheet. i made like 4
                    different palettes for this, the one above i think is paradise. this may or may not have to do with my
